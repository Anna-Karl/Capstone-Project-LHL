# Academic Investment: Tuition Costs vs. Future Earnings

## Project Overview

This project aims to visualize information about tuition fees, expected future income by major field of study, and the level of education in Canada and its provinces.

## Project Objectives

1. **Visualization of Tuition Fees and Future Earnings**:
   - Compare tuition costs across different provinces.
   - Analyze the expected future income for various major fields of study.
   - Correlate the level of education with future earnings.

## Project Execution

1. **Identifying Data Sources and Data Collection**:
   - Gather relevant data from credible sources such as Statistics Canada, university databases, and government reports.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data to remove any inconsistencies or errors.
   - Preprocess the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and identify key trends.

4. **Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation**:
   - Create visualizations to represent the data clearly and effectively.
   - Develop an interactive dashboard to allow users to explore the data.

5. **Interpretation of Results and Presentation Creation**:
   - Interpret the findings from the data analysis.
   - Create a presentation to communicate the results and insights gained from the project.

## Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Tableau**
  
## Future Goals

1. **Investigate Changes in Major Fields**:
   - Explore how many students decide to change their major field after their first/third years of study.

2. **Examine Completion Rates**:
   - Analyze the completion rates for different educational levels and major fields.

3. **Explore Impact of On-Campus Accommodation**:
   - Investigate the impact of on-campus accommodation conditins on tuition fees.
